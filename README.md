# SPM
Code to plot results of statistical parametric mapping for gait. 
Significant results are plotted at the base of the graphs as bars. The colours of the bar graphs vary whether variable A is greater or lesser than variable B, with different shades indicating different significant value

Normative data was obtained from paper: A public data set of overground and treadmill walking kinematics and kinetics of healthy individuals
